# Climate and Food Security Solutions Day - Data sets

Below, several data sources are provided as possible starting points for any data analysis related projects on climate change and food security. *These sources are not exhaustive and can be supplemented or supplanted with other datasets found online.*

# Local Datasets

1. **[Missouri Economic Research and Information Center](https://meric.mo.gov/data)**. This portal has:
 - Economic data
 - Industry data
 - Occupational data
 - Demographic data

2. **[Open Data for St. Louis County](https://data-stlcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=HubAppAll)**. Similar to the previous item, this portal contains information specific to St. Louis County on:
 - Property information
 - Zoning
 - Demographics and other related datasets to name a few


3. **[Miscellaneous datasets from the St. Louis City government](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/datasets/index.cfm)**. St. Louis City has a number of datasets over a wide range of interests that could be utilized to craft a more nuanced solution. A sample of the available datasets are provided below. Note that some datasets can only be obtained via API access or by request: 
 - Building permits
 - Census summaries
 - Election precincts 
 - Parks
 - Vacant buildings (and many more!)

# National and Global Datasets

1. The [County Business Patterns (CBP)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data/datasets.html) is a data source that provides subnational economic data by industry, released annually. Data within the past 20 - 30 years are provided and hosted by the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html). Relatedly, the US Census Bureau offers demographic, economic, and population data for subsequent download and use. One can also build customized maps from any variable within their data.

2. This data portal curated by **Data.gov** allows you to search for zip codes by address, city and state. You can also search for and discover information about a variety of other government data, including economic, environmental, and health data: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset).

3. **The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)** provides several weather datasets from local weather stations as well as Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). Daily maximum and minimum temperature data for over 11,000 weather stations around the world, including over 7,000 stations in the United States are available: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets).

4. The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** collects and analyzes data on environmental quality such as trends in air and water pollution, levels of pesticides and chemicals, and hazardous waste sites. Data is available at state, county and national level from **Data.gov**: [https://catalog.data.gov/organization/epa-gov](https://catalog.data.gov/organization/epa-gov).

5. The **EPA** also hosts national trend data on climate change indicators such as drought, temperature, heat waves, flooding, etc.: [https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/weather-climate](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/weather-climate).

6. The **Global Historical Climatology Network** dataset provides daily temperature and precipitation data for over 8,000 stations around the world, including over 3,000 stations in the United States: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html).

7. The **Kaggle Climate Change Earth Surface Temperature** dataset provides global land and ocean surface temperature data from 1750 to 2017: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data). A Kaggle account is required to access this data.

8. The **World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal** provides a variety of climate change data, including indicators of climate change, climate change projections, and climate change policies. Registration is required to access the data: [https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/).

9. Some of the Kaggle data is acquired from the **Berkeley Earth Global Land Temperature Dataset** which provides monthly global land surface temperature data from 1751 to the present. It is also used extensively in climate change research: [https://berkeleyearth.org/data/](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/).
